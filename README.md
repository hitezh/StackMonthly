What is StackMonthly?
=====================

Stack Overflow is one of the best programmer sites out there. Although mainly a Q&A site, there is tremendous learning value in questions asked by others.

Unfortunately finding good questions in the tens of thousands of questions on each subject is not possible on the site itself.

Enter StackMonthly
------------------

In the grand tradition of Hacker News Monthly and Ruby Monthly, I present StackMonthly. These are collections of best questions on the top topics each month on Stack Overflow.
